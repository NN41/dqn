* Keep new code and code changes as simple as possible.
* Adjust the style and robustness of new code and code changes to the style and robustness of the existing code. For example, if the existing code is clearly structured for personal use, adopt a similar style. If the code is clearly production-ready code, adopt a similar production-ready coding style.
